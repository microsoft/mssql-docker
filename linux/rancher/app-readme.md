# SQL Server

[Microsoft SQL Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server/) is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applicationsâ€”which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network (including the Internet). Microsoft markets at least a dozen different editions of Microsoft SQL Server, aimed at different audiences and for workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications with many concurrent users.

This helm chart creates a SQL Server workload using StatefulSet along with a Service and Azure Disk storage class.
