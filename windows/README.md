## Windows Containers
This includes samples for setting up mssql-server in Windows Containers. Currently it includes the following:
- __[mssql-server-windows-developer](mssql-server-windows-developer/)__
- __[mssql-server-windows-express](mssql-server-windows-express/)__
- __[mssql-server-windows](mssql-server-windows/)__

The docker hub repos are unavailable as SQL Server on windows container preview program is suspended. You can refer the below link to see how you can create your own custom image for SQL container.
