## About this sample

1. **Applies to:** SQL Server Developer Edition, Windows Server 2016, Windows 10
5. **Authors:** Perry Skountrianos [perrysk-msft]

## Before you begin

To run this sample, you need the following prerequisites.

**Software prerequisites:**

You can run the container with the following command.
(Note the you'll need Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10)

````
docker run -d -p 1433:1433 -v C:/temp/:C:/temp/ -e sa_password=<YOUR SA PASSWORD> -e ACCEPT_EULA=Y -e attach_dbs="<DB-JSON-CONFIG>" microsoft/mssql-server-windows-developer
````

- **-p HostPort:containerPort** is for port-mapping a container network port to a host port.
- **-v HostPath:containerPath** is for mounting a folder from the host inside the container.

  This can be used for saving database outside of the container.

- **-it** can be used to show the verbose output of the SQL startup script.

  Use this to debug the container in case of issues.

## Run this sample

The image provides two environment variables to optionally set: </br>
- **accept_eula**: Confirms acceptance of the end user licensing agreement found [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=746388)
- **sa_password**: Sets the sa password and enables the sa login
- **attach_dbs**: The configuration for attaching custom DBs (.mdf, .ldf files).

  This should be a JSON string, in the following format (note the use of SINGLE quotes!)
  ```
  [
	{
		'dbName': 'MaxDb',
		'dbFiles': ['C:\\temp\\maxtest.mdf',
		'C:\\temp\\maxtest_log.ldf']
	},
	{
		'dbName': 'PerryDb',
		'dbFiles': ['C:\\temp\\perrytest.mdf',
		'C:\\temp\\perrytest_log.ldf']
	}
  ]
  ```

  This is an array of databases, which can have zero to N databases.

  Each consisting of:
  - **dbName**: The name of the database
  - **dbFiles**: An array of one or many absolute paths to the .MDF and .LDF files.

	**Note:**
	The path has double backslashes for escaping!
	The path refers to files **within the container**. So make sure to include them in the image or mount them via **-v**!


This example shows all parameters in action:
```
docker run -d -p 1433:1433 -v C:/temp/:C:/temp/ -e sa_password=<YOUR SA PASSWORD> -e ACCEPT_EULA=Y -e attach_dbs="[{'dbName':'SampleDB','dbFiles':['C:\\temp\\sampledb.mdf','C:\\temp\\sampledb_log.ldf']}]" microsoft/mssql-server-windows-developer
```
